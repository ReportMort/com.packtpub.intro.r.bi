####An Overview

This code repository contains 2 folders:

1. *expenditures-revenue-app*
 - An example of a simple Shiny app that makes a revenue prediction using a linear regression model based on a user inputted expenditure amount
2. *campaign-creator-app*
 - An example of a more complex Shiny app that creates a clustering model based on method and number of clusters and assigns cluster membership to a list of potential campaign prospects.

Each folder contains a complete code base for a fully functional Shiny app. The details of how these apps work is outlined in Chapter 8 of the book. For more information view the README.md file in each of the app folders.
